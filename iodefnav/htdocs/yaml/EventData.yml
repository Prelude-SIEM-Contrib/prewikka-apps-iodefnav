name: EventData
description: 'The EventData class describes a particular event of the incident for
  a given set of hosts or networks.  This description includes the systems from which
  the activity originated and those targeted, an assessment of the techniques used
  by the intruder, the impact of the activity on the organization, and any forensic
  evidence discovered. '

    type: 
    description: EventData instances contained within another EventData instance inherit
      the values of the parent(s); this recursive definition can be used to group
      common data pertaining to multiple events.  When EventData elements are defined
      recursively, only the leaf instances (those EventData instances not containing
      other EventData instances) represent actual events.
